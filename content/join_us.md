# Learn to ring
We run a weekly learners session on Tuesday at 19:00. A group of experience ringing teachers attend to provide you the best possible tuition.

Whether you're brand new to ringing or have had a go in the past we would be very happy to welcome you, please reach out to learn@tringbellringers.org.uk to find out more.

# Current ringers
Anyone that has already learnt to ring is very welcome to join us at our practice night or on Sunday.

Tuesday practice - 19:00-21:00 (First hour focuses on more elementary ringing)  
Sunday service - 9:30-10:00

Access is normally via the West door, at the bottom of the tower.
