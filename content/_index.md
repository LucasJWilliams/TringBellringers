We are a friendly and diverse group that enjoy the unique and challenging hobby of bell ringing. This website should give you a good idea about us but if you have any questions please don't hesitate to [contact us]({{< ref "contact">}}).

You can find out about the fasinating history of the tower, bells and clock in the [about]({{< ref "about">}}) section.

If you're considering joining us, whether as an experienced ringer or a new recruit, we would be very happy to welcome you. Bell ringing is a struggling art so the more the merrier, check out the [join]({{< ref "join_us">}}) section for the details.
