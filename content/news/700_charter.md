The bells of SS Peter & Paul, Tring have played their part in commemorating the 700th anniversary of the granting in 1315 By Edward II of the Charter for market to be held in Tring.

A peal[^1] of [5183 changes of Tring Surprise Major](https://bb.ringingworld.co.uk/view.php?id=1094699) was rung at the beginning of the year.

At the beginning of June local ringers rang [1315 changes of Grandsire triples](https://bb.ringingworld.co.uk/view.php?id=1088992).

On the morning of June 29th (the patronal festival), a peal of [5088 changes of Tring Delight Major](https://bb.ringingworld.co.uk/view.php?id=972037) was rung and before the special evening service that day we rang a touch of 700 Grandsire and Plain Bob doubles as the civic dignitaries made their way to the church.   

Finally, to round off the celebrations we rang a date touch of [2015 changes of Grandsire triples](https://bb.ringingworld.co.uk/view.php?id=1153213).
