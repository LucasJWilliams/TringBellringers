Fifteen members of the [1st Halton (RAF) Red Kite ESU](http://www.1sthaltonscouts.org/red-kite-explorer-scout-unit/) with their leaders climbed the 36 step circular stairs to be welcomed to the ringing room by eight enthusiastic Tring ringers.

The fifteen split in to three smaller groups to visit the belfry in turn (more steps up!) where the concept of bells being ‘up’ or ‘down’ was explained, questions answered and, after donning ear defence, a bell was rung to demonstrate ‘full circle’ ringing (the bell rotates on its bearings through a full circle).

Meanwhile down in the ringing room an avalanche of questions about bells, ringing  and the church clock were answered by the resident experts.

Eventually, questions having slowed to a mere trickle, the enthusiastic ringers got to their feet, rang up the bells and demonstrated some ringing.

It was now the visitors’ turn to ring!  Under individual supervision they took hold and rang; one stroke and then the other. A few even started to put the strokes together!  Smiles, laughter and general happiness filled the room – visitors thrilled to ring and ringers equally thrilled to demonstrate and teach this skill.

Time passed by and we had to bid the Explorers farewell.

Thank you from us for visiting: perhaps we will see one or two of you join us to learn to ring, and don’t forget bell ringing can contribute towards a D of E skill at one level or another.
