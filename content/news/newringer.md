title: "A new ringer's story"

In May 2023 I climbed the ancient spiral staircase of the Tring tower for the first time and entered a new world beyond my imagining. Since then, it’s been a challenging journey, with a mixture of trepidation, fascination, enjoyment, and frustration. Overall, I’m pleased to be making steady progress.

I’ve always found pleasure in hearing church bells. If driving past a ringing tower I would habitually lower the car window to hear better. If walking by, I would stand and listen to the beautiful sound. It has never failed to lift my spirits. For a long time, I had harboured the idea of becoming a ringer and so I finally made contact and arranged my initial visit to the tower.

I was immediately welcomed, made to feel at home and part of the team. I received individual tuition from day one on how to handle a rope and control a bell. It takes practice. I have been supported all the way, and my skill is developing. Soon I was ringing rounds with the band, then ringing changes, and now I’m starting with the more complicated ringing methods. It’s particularly enjoyable to learn with experienced ringers who provide inspiration, advice, and encouragement.

I am in awe of the Tring bells. The oldest dates from 1622, and hundreds, if not thousands, of people have rung them before me. The heaviest, the tenor, weighs 905 Kg. I must admit, it’s sometimes scary being on the end of a rope attached to such a heavy piece of swinging metal. However, it’s deeply satisfying to develop the skill to control the bell, to be rewarded by hearing it strike correctly, and to contribute to the harmonious sound of ringing.

I’m still in the foothills of my journey, but I’m determined to continue. It requires commitment – I usually practice weekly in both Tring and Berkhamsted, as well as ringing for the Church service on a Sunday morning. It’s time consuming but enjoyable, and a pleasure to spend time with such a friendly and supportive group.

My only regret is that I left it until later in life, rather than responding to the call of the bells earlier! Better late than never. So, I heartily recommend anyone considering bell ringing to give it a go, and wind your way up that ancient spiral staircase.
