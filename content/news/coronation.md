Ring for The King In Tring! was the enticing recruitment slogan put about by the Tower Captain of Tring tower in preparation for the Coronation of King Charles, I took the opportunity to commit myself to mastering that technique, as  so many before me had, of that co-ordination of body and brain that seems so effortless when done by practiced ringers.

All I knew then about church bells was hearing their impressive, sonorous sound calling out over the town with their rung messages. Every Sunday they remind all that it is time for worship and prayer. They fill the air with joy and love for a wedding or with a sorrowful muted tolling for a funeral of a dear departed.
