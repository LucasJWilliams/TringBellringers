All I knew then about church bells was hearing their impressive, sonorous sound calling out over the town with their rung messages.</description></item><item><title>Visit by Halton explorer scouts</title><link>https://tringbells.org/news/scouts/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tringbells.org/news/scouts/</guid><description>Fifteen members of the 1st Halton (RAF) Red Kite ESU with their leaders climbed the 36 step circular stairs to be welcomed to the ringing room by eight enthusiastic Tring ringers.
The fifteen split in to three smaller groups to visit the belfry in turn (more steps up!) where the concept of bells being ‘up’ or ‘down’ was explained, questions answered and, after donning ear defence, a bell was rung to demonstrate ‘full circle’ ringing (the bell rotates on its bearings through a full circle).</description></item><item><title>In memoriam — HM Queen Elizabeth II</title><link>https://tringbells.org/news/queen_funeral/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tringbells.org/news/queen_funeral/</guid><description>Proclamation - 10th Rung following the Proclamation of His Majesty, King Charles III Eve of funeral - 18th Rung fully muffled for a special Evensong on the eve of the funeral of Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II Funeral day - 19th Tolling tenor half muffled an hour before the funeral service of Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II</description></item><item><title>Ringing for the Platinum Jubilee</title><link>https://tringbells.org/news/jubilee/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tringbells.org/news/jubilee/</guid><description>The following ringing took place on Friday the 3rd of June.

Since then, it’s been a challenging journey, with a mixture of trepidation, fascination, enjoyment, and frustration. Overall, I’m pleased to be making steady progress.
I’ve always found pleasure in hearing church bells. If driving past a ringing tower I would habitually lower the car window to hear better.</description></item><item><title>About us</title><link>https://tringbells.org/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tringbells.org/about/</guid><description>What is ringing? Each bell is attached to its headstock which is supported on bearings on a frame so that the bell swings easily. The earliest bells simply had an arm on the headstock to give leverage. By pulling a rope attached to this arm, the ringer made a bell swing and the bell chimed each time its clapper hit one side or the other. In continental Europe the use of bells swinging and chiming randomly is very prevalent.</description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://tringbells.org/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tringbells.org/contact/</guid><description>For all enquiries, including learning to ring please use the following email: contact@tringbells.org</description></item><item><title>Join us</title><link>https://tringbells.org/join-us/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tringbells.org/join-us/</guid><description>Learn to ring Why?

The ringers of Ss Peter &amp;amp; Paul are very proud of their role in continuing the long tradition of bellringing at Tring. The art of bellringing is unique to England and has changed little over centuries. Modern materials have been used in the bell chamber and the “tunes” that we ring have got slightly more complicated but, by and large, the sound of the bells celebrating your wedding will be the same as heard at weddings many hundreds of years ago.</description></item></channel></rss>
