Each bell is attached to its headstock which is supported on bearings on a frame so that the bell swings easily. The earliest bells simply had an arm on the headstock to give leverage. By pulling a rope attached to this arm, the ringer made a bell swing and the bell chimed each time its clapper hit one side or the other. In continental Europe the use of bells swinging and chiming randomly is very prevalent.</description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://tringbellringers.org.uk/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tringbellringers.org.uk/contact/</guid><description>General enquiries: info@tringbellringers.org.uk

The ringers of Ss Peter &amp;amp; Paul are very proud of their role in continuing the long tradition of bellringing at Tring. The art of bellringing is unique to England and has changed little over centuries. Modern materials have been used in the bell chamber and the “tunes” that we ring have got slightly more complicated but, by and large, the sound of the bells celebrating your wedding will be the same as heard at weddings many hundreds of years ago.</description></item></channel></rss>
