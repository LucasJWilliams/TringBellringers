The ringers of Ss Peter &amp;amp; Paul are very proud of their role in continuing the long tradition of bellringing at Tring. The art of bellringing is unique to England and has changed little over centuries. Modern materials have been used in the bell chamber and the “tunes” that we ring have got slightly more complicated but, by and large, the sound of the bells celebrating your wedding will be the same as heard at weddings many hundreds of years ago.</description></item></channel></rss>
